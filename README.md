# GO-LEGACY 

is a Monopoly game based on Unity Engine developed as a final project for the Computer Graphics
Animation course at Universitas Multimedia Nusantara. As the UI and gameplay designer, I focused on creating
an interactive and visually engaging digital board game experience inspired by the classic Monopoly, but with a
Harry Potter theme. The game features local multiplayer, AI opponents, and various strategic elements such as
property management, surprise cards, and player interactions. With an emphasis on smooth animations,
intuitive controls, and immersive game mechanics, GO LEGACY delivers a fun and dynamic gaming experience
for both casual and competitive players.
